# 3D face reconstruction
A Python programme using the Deep Learning librairies Pytorch and Pytorch3D that allows us to reconstruct any kind of face just by providing an image of someone.

## Installation

There is two options, first you use this code locally, second you use Google Colab. The second one will be comfortable to use once Pytorch3D is imported but his importation is long (20min). If you want to use it locally, it is **necessary** to have an efficient GPU.
***If you run it locally :***
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements to run the python programme.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
