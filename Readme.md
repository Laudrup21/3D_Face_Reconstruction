# 3D face reconstruction
A Python programme using the Deep Learning librairies Pytorch and Pytorch3D that allows us to reconstruct any kind of face just by providing an image of someone.

## Installation

There is two options, first you use this code locally, second you use Google Colab. The second one will be comfortable to use once Pytorch3D is imported but his importation is long (20min). If you want to use it locally, it is **necessary** to have an efficient GPU.
***If you run it locally :***
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements to run the python programme.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

We provide a Jupiter Notebook that explains how to use it and tell every piece of information that will help to run it. We'll right everything bellow so that you find every thing here but I recommand to look directly at the code and notebook that you will find in the folder *code*.
